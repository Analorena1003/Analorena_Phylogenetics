#Let's start by downloading a Staphylococcus aureus genome from NCBI using this command:

wget

#and let's make sure to unzip it so that we can access the .fna file directly (gunzip command). Make sure to use "head" and "tail" 

gunzip XXXXX
head XXXXX
tail XXXXX

#and

ls -lh

#Now let's get some basic stats using seqkit so we know what we're dealing with:

seqkit stats XXXXX.fna

#and

seqkit fx2tab -l -n -g XXXXXc.fna
