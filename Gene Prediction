#Let's start by downloading a Staphylococcus aureus genome from NCBI using this command:

wget

#and let's make sure to unzip it so that we can access the .fna file directly (gunzip command). Make sure to use "head" and "tail" 

gunzip XXXXX
head XXXXX
tail XXXXX

#and

ls -lh

#Now let's get some basic stats using seqkit so we know what we're dealing with:

seqkit stats XXXXX.fna

#and

seqkit fx2tab -l -n -g XXXXXc.fna

#Predicting Protein-Coding Genes with Prodigal
#Now we can start predicting genes using Prodigal. The main page for this tool is here: https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal

#Prodigal is an excellent gene-prediction tool that works well for finding protein-coding genes. The paper that described this tool is quite readable and nicely describes some of the primary challenges of gene prediction Link to Prodigal paper!

#To install this tool you will probably be able to use Anaconda with the bioconda channel:

conda install prodigal -c bioconda

#Keep this general command format in mind- in future tutorials I won't explicitly put download instructions for tools unless they are atypical.

After installation, you can take a look at the help menu:

#prodigal -h
